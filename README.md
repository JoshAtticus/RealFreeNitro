# RealFreeNitro
(ab)Use Opera GX's promotion in order to get free Nitro gift links (payment method required!). For educational purposes only, don't sue me Opera (your browser sucks anyways).

# Running
Go onto your computer, install python and git if you haven't already (there's thousands of tutortials on youtube I'm not going to tell you how), make sure they're in PATH, then run these commands depending on your OS

## macOS and most Linux
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoshAtticus/RealFreeNitro
cd RealFreeNitro
pip3 install requests
python3 main.py
```
If you're on Linux and you use a different version of python, replace python3 with python 3.xx and pip3 with python3.xx -m pip3 where xx is the last 2 digits in your python version.

## Windows
```batch
git clone https://github.com/JoshAtticus/RealFreeNitro
cd RealFreeNitro
pip install requests
py main.py
```

If you're on Windows, make sure you're NOT using the Microsoft Store version of python (python3), but rather the one from https://python.org (py)

# Tokens
Tokens are the user ID you use to generate these codes. You need to install Spyware for Gamers (aka Opera GX) in order to get them, once you have it you can uninstall it. If you don't want to do that, here's one I've provided for you: **ae8d4348-6303-47cb-affb-349b8ce7a0fb**

You can get one yourself by going to [Opera GX's free nitro page](https://www.opera.com/gx/discord-nitro)), opening the Network tab in developer tools, click the claim button and look for requests to https://api.discord.gx.games/v1/direct-fulfillment or have the term direct-fulfilment in the name (NOT PREFLIGHT!!!), then click it and then go to the request
